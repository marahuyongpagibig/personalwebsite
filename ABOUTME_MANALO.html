<br>
Azyiah Maria Manalo is a student of Gen. Pio Del Pilar National High School <br>
 that dreams to be a Medical Doctor (M.D) in the near future. <br><br><br>
 
 Azyiah is a slow learner that strives hard to build her own future. She focuses on <br> 
 studying because she believes that she can someday help her parents through the <br>
 leesons that she studied. As a child, she dreams of spoiling her own parents and <br>
 take care of them. <br><br><br> 

She aspires to be a singing Doctor that loves to dance. Singing and dancing are <br>
 her talents. Azyiah likes to play with babies and puppies. For her alone time, <br>
 she loves to listen to music and reflect on what happened on her life. <br><br><br>
 
 Her hobbies are journaling, sleeping, and painting. Listening to music while day <br>
 dreaming is her favourite activity. She is a home buddy that would occassionaly <br>
 leave the house. I also have a dog who loves sleeping more than I do.
